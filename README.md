Hero Section:

Creating a Cool Start:
I'm making a cool section at the top of the page called the Hero Section. Inside it, I'm putting a big picture in the background. Then, on top of that, I'm adding another picture. But this picture is special because it spins around in a circle! I'm doing this by using animations and keyframes. It makes the Hero Section look really fun and exciting!

**How GST Processing Works:**

When you select items from our menu and proceed to checkout, the order total is calculated based on the prices entered into input tags using JavaScript. Our script also factors in the applicable GST rate to provide you with the final amount payable, inclusive of GST.

For example, if your order subtotal is 1000Rs and the GST rate is 18%, our website will automatically calculate and display the total amount due as 1180 (subtotal + GST)+ Tip(1000).
